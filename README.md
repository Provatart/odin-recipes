# 🍽️ Recipes Project

This is a simple web project where I showcase my basic HTML skills by creating a collection of delicious recipes. Each recipe has its own dedicated page with ingredients, instructions, and visuals.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and semantic HTML structure  
- Multiple linked recipe pages  
- Use of headings, lists, links, and images  
- Basic navigation between pages  

## 📁 Structure
